# PK studies in Tg276 mouse model
# human FcRn/mouse β2m
# Human IgG has almost same binding properties to hFcRn/mβ2m comparing with hFcRn/hβ2m
# Presence of mouse IgG in the serum
# Since mIgG does not bind to hFcRn, doesn't compete for binding to hFcRn with injected hIgG
# Tg276 mice has mouse Fcγ receptors
# AUC: AUCinf_μg*days/ml
# Clearance: ml/days/kg
# Vss: ml/kg
# beta_phase_Thalf: hrs
