# PK studies in Tg276 mouse model
# human FcRn/mouse β2m
# Human IgG has almost same binding properties to hFcRn/mβ2m comparing with hFcRn/hβ2m
# Presence of mouse IgG in the serum
# Since mouse IgG does not bind to hFcRn, it can not compete for binding to hFcRn with injected human IgG
# Tg276 mice has mouse Fcγ receptors
