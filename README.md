# FcRn-trafficking


## Meeting notes

Thank your for your time and it was good meeting. I attached my presentation slides. You can know the story of this project, briefly. 

About the new mouse model data, please see the slide #17 and #18. 

These models are newly developed mouse by our collaborator. The differences between previous mouse model (TG276) vs. Scarlet (and Marlene) are 1. different integration method of human FcRn gene 2. Expression level of FcRn 3. FcRn positive tissues in mouse 4. mouse (TG276) vs. human beta 2 microglobulin (scarlet and marlene)....

PK data from Scarlet and Marlene can change slightly because we added more N for these mouse study. I will get the final data today. 

1. Scarlet has hFcγR + hFcRn + hβ2m + hIgG1. The concentration of serum IgG is 0.3-2 mg/ml. 
2. Marlene has hFcγR + hFcRn + hβ2m. There is not endogenous IgG. 
3. 17th slide contains several PK values of antibody variants in Scarlet and Marlene
4. 18th slide contains the plots in several mice.

If you have any questions, please let me know it.

## Figure notes

Current version looks great to me ! 
I agree with your opinion. To help reader's understanding, we had better include visual model scheme in the figure. If you want to assemble figures by yourself, here are the NPG instructions, 1. Width: 7 in for double column, 3.5 in for one column. 2. Font: Sans Serif (or Microsoft Sans Serif). 3. Each axis should start from 0. So we need to use axis breaks. 

Except #3, you don't need to follow it. After getting the PDF version of figures, I will slightly edit them for unifying the figure styles (fonts size, colors and etc).
